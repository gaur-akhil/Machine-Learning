Business Context:The project seeks to understand the overall demand for labour in the Armenian online job market from  the  19,000  job  postings  from  2004  to  2015  posted  on  CareerCenter,  an  Armenian  human resource portal. Through textmining on this data, we will be able to understand the nature of the ever-changing job market, as well as the overall demand for labour in the Armenia economy. The data was originally scraped from a Yahoo! Mailing group.

Business Objectives:
Our main business objectives are to understand the dynamics of the labour market of Armenia using the online job portal post as a proxy. A secondary objective is to implement advanced text analytics as a proof of concept to create additional features such as enhanced search function that can add additional value to the users of the job portal.

Business questions answering to our business objectives are defined as follows:
Job Nature and Company Profiles: What are the types of jobs that are in demand in Armenia? How are the job natures changing over time?
Desired Characteristics and Skill-Sets: What are the desired characteristics and skill-set of the candidates based on the job description dataset? How these are desired characteristics changing over time?
IT  Job Classification: Build  a  classifier  that  can  tell  us  from  the  job  description  and  company description whether a job is IT or not, so that this column can be automatically populated for new job postings. After doing so, understand what important factors are which drives this classification.
Similarity of Jobs:Given a job title, find the 5 top jobs that are of a similar nature, based on the job post.
